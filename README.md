## Here's some neat projects I work on:

[**DSharpPlus**](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus): Second largest .NET Discord library, time-tested and loved by many. In late 2021, I was promoted to a maintainer.

[**Remora.Discord**](https://github.com/Remora/Remora.Discord): One of the lesser-known .NET Discord libraries, built with a data-oriented design reminscent of Rust.
    
I've also made ~~several~~ (many, [see for yourself-](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi?tab=repositories&q=Remora)) libraries for Remora. Here's a list of the cool/useful ones:
- [Help Command System](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/RemoraHelpSystem)
- [Builders (EmbedBuilder, etc)](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/Remora.Discord.Builders)
- [In-process sharding](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/RemoraShardHelper)
- [Delegate Resonders (think ASP.NET minimal APIs)](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/RemoraDelegateDispatch)

[**Silk!**](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/Silk): My first Discord bot which I started on in 2020. It's been a great learning experience.

[**Kobalt**](https://github.com/VelvetToroyashi/Kobalt): The next generation of Silk!; built from the ground up on the learnings of making large-scale applications, utilizing microservices.
