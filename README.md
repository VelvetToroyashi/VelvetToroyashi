Velvet Toroyashi, or just Velvet. Most of my time is spent writing code, so I don't actually have much to put here!

Stay a while, will you?

I also work on some projects; here's the more notable ones:

[**DSharpPlus**](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus): Second largest .NET Discord library, time-tested and loved by many. In late 2021, I was promoted to a maintainer.


[**Remora.Discord**](https://github.com/Remora/Remora.Discord): One of the lesser-known .NET Discord libraries, built with correctness in mind, and a data-oriented design reminscent of Rust.
    
(I've also made several libraries for Remora, such as a [help system](https://github.com/VelvetThePanda/RemoraHelpSystem), [builder abstraction library](https://github.com/VelvetThePanda/Remora.Discord.Builders), and [in-process shard helper](https://github.com/VelvetThePanda/RemoraShardHelper)).

[**Silk!**](https://silkbot.cc/src): My first Discord bot, initially using DSharpPlus, and then ported to Remora. Started in mid 2020, and bringing lots of learning experience along the way.

[**Kobalt**](https://github.com/VelvetThePanda/Kobalt): The next generation of Silk!; built from the ground up on the learnings of making large-scale applications, utilizing microservices.
